            <h3>Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately recognize handwritten digits from images. Leveraging the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of handwritten digits (0-9), the model is trained to identify and classify each digit effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Handwritten English Alphabet Recognition using Transfer Learning</h3>
            <p>This project aims to develop an effective system for recognizing handwritten English alphabets using Transfer Learning techniques. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, such as VGG16 or ResNet, the system fine-tunes these architectures to classify images of handwritten letters (A-Z) efficiently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Classification of X-Ray images for Pneumonia Prediction</h3>
            <p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of chest X-ray images to predict the presence of pneumonia. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system analyzes medical imaging data to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more accurately and efficiently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Content based Video Retrieval using Transfer Learning</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on developing a content-based video retrieval system that utilizes Transfer Learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of content based video retrieval. By employing pre-trained models, such as ResNet, the system extracts meaningful features from video frames to facilitate quick and precise video searches based on content.</p>
